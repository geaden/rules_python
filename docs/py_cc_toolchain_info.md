C/C++ information about the Python runtime.

**FIELDS**


| Name  | Description |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| <a id="PyCcToolchainInfo-headers"></a>headers |  (struct) Information about the header files, with fields: * providers_map: a dict of string to provider instances. The key should be   a fully qualified name (e.g. `@rules_foo//bar:baz.bzl#MyInfo`) of the   provider to uniquely identify its type.<br><br>  The following keys are always present:     * CcInfo: the CcInfo provider instance for the headers.     * DefaultInfo: the DefaultInfo provider instance for the headers.<br><br>  A map is used to allow additional providers from the originating headers   target (typically a `cc_library`) to be propagated to consumers (directly   exposing a Target object can cause memory issues and is an anti-pattern).<br><br>  When consuming this map, it's suggested to use `providers_map.values()` to   return all providers; or copy the map and filter out or replace keys as   appropriate. Note that any keys beginning with `_` (underscore) are   considered private and should be forward along as-is (this better allows   e.g. `:current_py_cc_headers` to act as the underlying headers target it   represents).    |
| <a id="PyCcToolchainInfo-python_version"></a>python_version |  (str) The Python Major.Minor version.    |
